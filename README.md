foo_disccache (or was it foo_diskcache?)
=============

Latest release will always be at: https://b.goeswhere.com/foo_disccache.fb2k-component

Install by drag-droppingthe above file on the foobar2000 "components" preferences page.


This will attempt to increase foobar2000's efficiency at reading files from the disc,
if you have sufficient free RAM available.  It shouldn't make things too much worse when you don't.

This will allow the drive the music is being read from to spin down (saving noise/power) more
frequently, and will assist with uninterrupted music playback when the system is under heavy IO load.
